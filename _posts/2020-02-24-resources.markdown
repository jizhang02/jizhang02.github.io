## Say something

The reason why I wrote this article is because I think everything should be sharable so that people can make progress. 

Leave a comment if you know some awesome resources.


* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
It's a online LaTeX editor. You can share your work with other colleages.
* [WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/)
WikiCFP is a semantic wiki for Calls For Papers in science and technology fields. There are about 50,000 CFPs on WikiCFP. Over 100,000 researchers use WikiCFP each month.
* [SCI-HUB](https://sci-hub.se/)
The first website in the world to provide mass & public access to research papers.
* [Arxiv Sanity Preserver](https://www.arxiv-sanity.com/)
Web interface for browsing, search and filtering recent arxiv submissions.
* [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/)
Entering tables in LaTeX documents can be burdensome because of the necessary formatting directives. For this purpose we created this online generator which (hopefully) will allow you to generate LaTeX code you can just copy & paste into your document's source. Our editor is close to WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Got) principle, i.e. the table displayed in the editor should resemble the final table.
* [CNN Explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/)
CNN EXPLAINER: Learning Convolutional Neural Networks with Interactive Visualization. It is a web-based interavtive CNN explainer. A very good tool to understand how the CNN works visually.
* [Explainable AI Demos](https://lrpserver.hhi.fraunhofer.de/)
Machine learning models, in particular deep neural networks (DNNs), are characterized by very high predictive power, but in many cases, are not easily interpretable by a human. Interpreting a nonlinear classifier is important to gain trust into the prediction, and to identify potential data selection biases or artifacts. This demo shows how decisions made by systems based on artificial intelligence can be explained by LRP.
* [Speechnotes](https://speechnotes.co/)
Speechnotes is a powerful speech-enabled online notepad, designed to empower your ideas by implementing a clean & efficient design, so you can focus on your thoughts.
* [CVPR 2020 Tutorials](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/program/tutorials)
CVPR is the premier annual computer vision event comprising the main conference and several co-located workshops and short courses. With its high quality and low cost, it provides an exceptional value for students, academics and industry researchers.
* [Machine Learning Summer Schools](http://mlss.cc/index.html)
The machine learning summer school series was started in 2002 with the motivation to promulgate modern methods of statistical machine learning and inference. It was motivated by the observation that while many students are keen to learn about machine learning, and an increasing number of researchers want to apply machine learning methods to their research problems, only few machine learning courses are taught at universities. Machine learning summer schools present topics which are at the core of modern Machine Learning, from fundamentals to state-of-the-art practice. The speakers are leading experts in their field who talk with enthusiasm about their subjects.
* [Conference Partner](https://www.myhuiban.com/) "Conference Partner" was created in 2011. It is an academic website for conferences and journals information.
* [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/)THE WORLD'S LARGEST WEB DEVELOPER SITE
* [Personnal website by Jack Cui](https://cuijiahua.com/) A personnal website which is about Machine learning and Deep learning.
* [Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/) The mission of Papers with Code is to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code and evaluation tables.
* [Model Zoo](https://modelzoo.co/) Discover open source deep learning code and pretrained models.
* [Top Computer Science conference](http://www.guide2research.com/topconf/) The Top Conferences Ranking for Computer Science & Electronics was prepared by Guide2Research, one of the leading portals for computer science research providing trusted data on scientific contributions since 2014.
