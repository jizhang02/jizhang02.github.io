## Say something

The reason why I wrote this article is because I think everything should be sharable so that people can make progress. 

Leave a comment if you know some awesome resources.


* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
It's a online LaTeX editor. You can share your work with other colleages.
* [List of LaTeX mathematical symbols](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols)
* [WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/)
WikiCFP is a semantic wiki for Calls For Papers in science and technology fields. There are about 50,000 CFPs on WikiCFP. Over 100,000 researchers use WikiCFP each month.
* [Arxiv Sanity Preserver](https://www.arxiv-sanity.com/)
Web interface for browsing, search and filtering recent arxiv submissions.
* [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/)
Entering tables in LaTeX documents can be burdensome because of the necessary formatting directives. For this purpose we created this online generator which (hopefully) will allow you to generate LaTeX code you can just copy & paste into your document's source. Our editor is close to WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Got) principle, i.e. the table displayed in the editor should resemble the final table.
* [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
Online drawing tool.
* [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)
Connected papers is a unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work.
* [Scidown](https://www.xueky.com/) 
Paper downloader.
* [Speechnotes](https://speechnotes.co/)
Speechnotes is a powerful speech-enabled online notepad, designed to empower your ideas by implementing a clean & efficient design, so you can focus on your thoughts.
* [CVPR 2020 Tutorials](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/program/tutorials)
CVPR is the premier annual computer vision event comprising the main conference and several co-located workshops and short courses. With its high quality and low cost, it provides an exceptional value for students, academics and industry researchers.
* [Machine Learning Summer Schools](http://mlss.cc/index.html)
The machine learning summer school series was started in 2002 with the motivation to promulgate modern methods of statistical machine learning and inference. It was motivated by the observation that while many students are keen to learn about machine learning, and an increasing number of researchers want to apply machine learning methods to their research problems, only few machine learning courses are taught at universities. Machine learning summer schools present topics which are at the core of modern Machine Learning, from fundamentals to state-of-the-art practice. The speakers are leading experts in their field who talk with enthusiasm about their subjects.
* [Conference Partner](https://www.myhuiban.com/)
"Conference Partner" was created in 2011. It is an academic website for conferences and journals information.
